## Project Tasks & Evidence

### Task 1: Alert Data Ingestion
Security alerts were ingested from a CSV file to simulate SIEM-generated alerts.

### Task 2: Severity Classification
Rule-based logic was implemented to classify alerts into LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH
severity based on alert type and description.

### Task 3: Alert Prioritization
Alerts were prioritized using severity and risk score to reduce SOC alert noise.

### Task 4: Incident Ticket Generation
High-severity alerts were escalated into incident tickets with incident ID,
impact analysis, and recommended response actions.
